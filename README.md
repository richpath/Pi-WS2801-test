# Pi-WS2801-test
Python code for testing the control of a WS2801 LED display
The "keyboard" test can be run via Python on any system without a joystick or LED display board.
The "joysitck" version is created specifically to interface with a Logitech RumblePad 2 controller and a custom-built display grid of 20x10 WS2801 LEDs.
